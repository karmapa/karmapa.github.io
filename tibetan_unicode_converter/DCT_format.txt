DCT FILE FORMAT DESCRIPTION

File is split in blocks, each block is separated by crlf 0x13, 0x10.

First few blocks are headers and last block is text flow.

Very first header block is version signature.
Second block is default encoding code page. (AnsiTibetan is 0x10, TibetanAnsi is 0x11).
Other headers are a set of string fields separated by tab.

For instance:
hdr TAB desiredfont TAB arial
Desired font and encoding are the only headers we currently do not ignore.

Last block has this format:
1 TAB ! TAB (text flow).
The number one here has unknown meaning, maybe there could be more text flows, but I never seen so. All pages are in the same text flow as much as I know.

Now I describe the format of the text flow.
All characters above 32 are the text in the default encoding.
Characters 0x10-0x17 are code page selection for the next character. For instance 0x10 65 0x10 66 16 67 is the text "ABC". (It is hard to type hex on ipad so I may mix).
The code page selection is only effective for a single character.
Other codes under 32 are special codes.
9 is tab.
11 is new line.
12 is new page.
25 is extended command followed by data.

Extended command has own syntax: SUBCODE ARGUMENTS

Subcodes.
For example 99 is a subcode for text color change.
0x46 is a subcode for font parameters change.
101 for center.
98 for bold.
105 for italic.
Etc.

Arguments.
Arguments is a string. To know the length of an arguments string each character in it is preeceded by 27. So here is example command to select font size 18.

25 0x46 27 '1' 27 32 27 '0' 27 32 27 '1' 27 '8'

So basically arguments is just a 27-encoded string.
In the above example the decoded arguments string is simply '1 0 18'.
So 1, 0, 18 are subargs. 1 is a subcommand, 0 is open or close, 18 is font size.
We only know two subcommands for the font params command:
0 is select font face from table (followed by font number in the table).
1 is select font size.
Open/close is 0/1.
18 is font size.

Only font properties size and face has open/close bit. Other subcodes like bold or center are just flip-flop switch style.

Thats it basically.
